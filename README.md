Alfresco Patch to Solr6 multiple locale search
================================================

Described at issue [ALF-21940](https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ALF-21940)

This code is not ready for **production** environments as documented in:
https://github.com/Alfresco/SearchServices/issues/234#issuecomment-699843033

**DISCLAIMER**

SOLR 6 can be configured to work as SOLR 4 was working in previous Alfresco versions by uncommenting **alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.N** properties in `/opt/solr6/solrhome/conf/shared.properties`.

```
alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.0={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}text
alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.1={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}content
alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.2={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}mltext
```

You can perform this operation and there is **no** need to install this addon.

Once this `shared.properties` file has been modified is required to rebuild SOLR indexes. After that, every searching will be performed in Alfresco with cross-language support and you'll get the same behaviour that is provided by this patch.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!**
Please, don't use this plugin in production environments, as it has **big** impact in search performance, apply the configuration described in the above lines instead.



**Description**

Alfresco when store a new document save a property called `sys:locale`, this property is based in the browser selected language. When another user with the browser in a different language go search for the document by the name can not found it, because the `locale` value is different. This problem is only detected in Solr6.

This patch, remove the parameter locale in Solr6 http requests.
